# Hand-FaceRefinerLatentUpscalex2
ComfyUI hand/face refiner w/ x2 latent upscale

Download .json and add to ComfyUI/web folder. Use "Load" button on Menu.



FOR HANDS TO COME OUT PROPERLY:

The hands from the original image must be in good shape. The refiner improves hands, it DOES NOT remake bad hands. It detects hands and improves what is already there. It will only make bad hands worse. It MAY occasionally fix alignment errors (rare).



UPSCALERS:

IF you get OOM message with regular VAE decoding it will retry and should work fine.

There are other upscaler options below that will work WITH additional effort. Change at your own discretion. Not responisble if it breaks the workflow!



FACE REFINER:

Works great. I wouldn't mess with it much.
